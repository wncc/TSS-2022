<b><h2>Basics of React & installation</h2></b>
So what is React?

### <b>What is ReactJS?</b>:
React or ReactJS, in simple words is a JavaScript library for designing frontend UI. It is free, open-source and is maintained by Facebook (now Meta) with many individual developers and comapnies. 
<br>
<br>
You might be wondering: <br><br>
<h3> <b> Why to use React? <br> </b></h3>
Why learn a bloated JavaScript framework when we can also make our website using CSS frameworks with HTML and JS?

Well, Vanilla JS is good. It's fast, easy to learn, beginner-friendly, and versatile. But React comes the handiest when you are designing complex large-scale projects that require quick rendering and fast API processing with seamless integration of backend servers and databases. 
For example, React plays a very crucial role in making <b><i>Single Page Applications</i></b>. <br>
<br>This means that when you click a link on the web page, the entire web page is not loaded, it's rather just updated by rendering only those parts of the web page which are meant to be changed. This makes the use of less processing power on the server-side, quick response time and fast client-side rendering making React much more efficient. 
Another example shows React's versatility. Let's say you want to integrate the backend to your frontend and want to link databases like MongoDB with your webpage. In this case, React makes it the most efficient to do so with many advantages over VanillaJS.  <br>
<br>
You must have been clear by now why React is better than Vanilla JS. <br><br>
<h3><b>React vs Angular</b></h3>

There are many other JavaScript libraries/frameworks like React. The most popular ones are AngularJS and VueJS. Why not use them? Well, the use of each varies according to the requirements of the projects. What you choose, hardly matters and it's more like a personal choice than a universal one.<br>
<br>
But still, React has got an upper edge over the two. Let's compare React with equally popular AngularJS:
<ul>
<li>AngularJS is more <i>bloated</i> than React. This is because AngularJS is a full-fledged framework while React is a library. This means Angular includes has a larger code base and more complex mechanism than React.
<li> Angular being more bloated makes it slower than React.
<li>Angular code is large and bulky. If it takes you 50 lines of code to do something in React, it would take you 70-90 lines of code to do the same thing in Angular. This makes Angular code files larger and space-occupying. In short, React is more size-efficient than Angular.</li></ul>
<br>But using a framework/library is a very subjective point in practice. Sometimes Angular serves better than React. For example, Firebase authentication implementation on Angular is much more seemless and easier than React. <br>
It varies from organization to organization and what framework/library they use. <br>
Instagram, Meta, Bloomberg, Uber, Skype, and Discord are some of the tech giants that use React for developing their web apps. On the other hand, Microsoft, Google, and Samsung are some of the companies that rely on Angular. While many companies use both like Apple. Not to mention that our insti-app website is written in Angular but the Resobin website frontend is written in React. <br>So yes, it's a very subjective choice. 
<br><br>
We hope its convincing enough to use React. <br>
<br>

### <b>NodeJS Installation</b>:

In order to use react, you much first install NodeJS. <br>
The question comes: What is NodeJS?<br><br>
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.

In simple words, NodeJS creates a JavaScript runtime environment to host web pages. That's the simplest definition of NodeJS we should be concerned with being a beginner. <br>
<br>Why do we use NodeJS for React?<br>
There are a couple of reasons to use RectJS and NodeJS together. You can have a look at <a href="https://programmers.io/web-development-using-reactjs-with-nodejs/#:~:text=Reasons%20to%20Use%20Node%20JS%20and%20React%20JS%20Together&text=High%20Server%20Load%3A%20Using%20Node,enables%20sharing%20within%20React%20JS."> this article </a> to know about it.

<br>Now it's clear why we use NodeJS, let's jump to its installation. You can download NodeJS for your OS from <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/"> this link </a>. Once done with the download, install it as the prompt says. GREAT! You're done with NodeJS installation!
<br><br>
<h3><b> Creating your First React App</b></h3>

Now, let's create your first React app. <br>
There are two ways of creating your React app. One is by using Vite and the other is a classical method of using the command `npx create-react-app my-app`. While the second method is widely used, we are going to prefer the former one. Why? It's actually because Vite offers a lot of advantages over the `create-react-app`. 
<br> If you want to get yourself convinced that why should you use Vite, then you can head over to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYr9HBojBaQ">this video </a> to know about it. 

Head over to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZBSelnyLgp4"> this video </a> to create your first React app using Vite. You can also watch <a href="https://youtu.be/LQQ3CR2JTX8">this interesting video</a> on using Vite over React if you want(this video is optional viewing material). On a side note, we recomend reading <a href="https://dev.to/keefdrive/create-react-app-vs-vite-2amn">this wonderful article </a> as well. 
<br><br>
<h3><b>React Folder Structure </b></h3>
<br>
Once you are into your project folder, you might be overwhelmed by the number of different folders in front of your screen. You might be wondering about the use of each folder, why is it important, and how to make use of it. Worry not, we've got you covered. React folder structure can be confusing initially, but not much if you follow the right resources. You can have a look at <a href="https://youtu.be/XEO3mFvrDx0">this video</a> under the <b>beginner timestamp</b>. Don't watch it completely or else you will end up confusing yourself, just watch it till<i> 3:31</i> i.e. till the end of the beginner timestamp. Or else, you can also watch <a href="https://youtu.be/9VIiLJL0H4Y"> this video</a> as well for understanding folder structure.
<br>
On an additional note, many of you might be wondering what are files with .json extension files. These files are very important and useful as you go along your web development journey, so we recommend you guys learn about them well. You can learn JSON files from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uw_rP5bV9r0&ab_channel=edureka%21"> here</a>.  
<br><br>

## <b>React Components </b>

You saw the previous video and found the word "component" used a lot of times. So what are React components? <br>
You can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/Y2hgEGPzTZY">this video </a> to learn about React components. <br>
W3 School also has a really good <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_components.asp#:~:text=Components%20are%20independent%20and%20reusable,will%20concentrate%20on%20Function%20components.">reading material </a> for react components that you can use. 
Apart from that you can also learn from GeeksForGeeks <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/reactjs-components/">here</a>! <br><br>

><p><i>A short note:</i> We know that this week's resources are new for many beginner web developers and might be exhausting and confusing at first. If you find the resources a bit intensive and think that you are unable to follow, please try googling. Google your errors, bugs, and doubts. Learn by doing stuff. Learn from websites like stack exchange, W3 schools, free code camp, and whatnot. There are tons of resources on the internet that you can learn from. Lastly, we are also there if you spot a doubt and are unable to clear it.</p>

<h2><b> <br>JavaScript Syntax Extension</b></h2>
There are still a lot of things that one must know to use React. Most of them will be covered in later weeks. You need to learn JSX(JavaScript Syntax Extension). JSX, as the name indicates is the extended syntax of JavaScript used in React. 
<br>The question comes: <b>What is JSX exactly?</b><br>
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript that lets you use HTML tags right inside your JavaScript file. Instead of creating, configuring, and appending your HTML tags through JavaScript objects, you can create the elements using an XML-like syntax that will generate the DOM elements for you behind the scenes.<br>Fundamentally, JSX is used by React to ease the creation of react components. You make React components with VanillaJS, but it would be very hectic to add and import external files and scripts. So, JSX eases this process by including internal HTML tags inside JavaScript code. <br>
You can learn JSX from <a href="https://youtu.be/7fPXI_MnBOY"> here </a>
<br><br>
<h2> <b><i>React under the hood</i></b></h2>

You have ever wondered how this beautiful piece of technology works? How the React architecture makes it work so seamlessly and fast? If you are curious, then we recommend watching the following videos:

<a href="https://youtu.be/7YhdqIR2Yzo">How does React work?</a><br>
<a href="https://youtu.be/gApwC9Ek9yo">How React works behind the scene? </a>

These two videos will give a good knowledge about React's working process in a brief and easy language. The second video talks about React VDOM(Virtual Document Object Model) which is one of the key ideas on SPA(single page application) and making React web apps faster and more efficient. The first video talks in general about all the processes and working of React including react elements, components, JSX, `React.createElement` command, inter-conversion of JSX into pure react code with Babel, component instance, reconciliation, the Diffing Algorithm, and rendering. 
<br><br>Since, these topics are not required to create web apps, they are optional. But watching them is only useful if you wonder how to react architecture works under the hood. There are many other advanced videos on react's system architecture but they are currently not in the scope of this course. <br><br><br>

<h1>Assignment - Week 2</h1>

You guys might be aware that all the weeks following week 1 will have assignments. This is time to tell you about the week 2 assignment which is the first assignment of this course.

<br>
<h3>Project Statement:</h3>

Let's say you are going to Bangalore for your dream internship in your dream company. You are going to live in a PG near your office. Your PG offers several facilities such as a large inventory of sports equipment, musical instruments for music enthusiasts, and tech inventory having stuff like sensors, breadboards, Arduino, micro-controllers, etc. 
<br>But one thing that you're pissed about is the issuing system. Your PG still uses the old-school method of booking these things using pen-paper. You, being a pro programmer decided to make an inventory portal for your PG. 
<br><br>
<h3>Assignment for this week</h3>
For this week, your task is to create the basic landing page for the inventory portal. It must include:
<ul>
<li>A top navbar having tabs like music inventory, sports inventory, tech inventory, and a tab for the contact us page.</li>
<li>A testimonial div for showing the top reviews on the landing page itself. </li>
<li>An input box that takes in the user input about the name, email address, room number, etc. to subscribe to the newsletter would inform the users about the new equipment being added to the inventory. </li></ul>

Any added functionality would be considered a bonus! So put your creative minds to work and all the best for the assignment!
